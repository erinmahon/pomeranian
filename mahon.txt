Hello! I am Erin Mahon, I have been coding since September when I began with NYCDA's September session. I have learned so much, and have so much more to learn- and I am really excited about it. I enjoy front end development and I aspire to be a Javascript Ninja. I have a BBA in Marketing from Pace University, and a professional background in confectionary sales. I also have expereince building websites with WordPress, which sparked my interest in persuing web development. I recently bought a house in the Pennsport section of Philadelphia and live there with my boyfriend Michael and two dogs, Wolf & Porter.
